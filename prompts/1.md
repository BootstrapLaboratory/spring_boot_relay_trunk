you are in vscode. in devcontainers. i already created initial devcontainers setup for my project.

the project is a template/boilerplace for Spring Boot with maven on Java 21.

java is installed. and maven also. now i want you to create for me an project with spring boot. It must be root module with maven (will contain dependency list and its versions. basically to store dependency versions. and two submodules. two microservices. and one library in Kotlin, that will be used in two java microservices).

I want to use Lombok and MapStruct in java modules

so. main goal is to be able to comfortably develop in vscode this project. vscode java plugins must detect all settings from maven configuration. if something requres configuration in vscode settings, then we do it in workspace .vscode/settings.json, because environment if always the same (in devcontainer).

database is postgres. and its already up and runing using devcontianer.

so check out my devcontainer configuration and start implementing fully functional project. Best practices in mind. You have full control. you can use spring initializr, if needed, or go with beter way if you think so.

if you need clarification, then ask me
